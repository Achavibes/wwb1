            <h2>Contemporary Situation</h2>
            <p>In the wake of the Anglophone crisis in Cameroon; in the restive regions of the North West and South West, there have been massive human rights abuses by the armed forces and armed groups that have given birth to a humanitarian situation.</p>
            <p>The on-going crisis seems to be deteriorating each passing day; women and children have been affected disproportionately, incidents of Gender-based violence are on a rise, death rates keep soaring, arson, abductions, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, forced migration and gross impairment to physical integrities. This crisis has brought untold sufferings and increased vulnerabilities to the affected persons across the Anglophone regions. Thus WWB has been involved in advocating against these abuses and also providing humanitarian assistance to the needs of these affected persons through personal actions and referral pathways.</p>
            <P>The announcement that Michelin Uptis Tire Store was developing an “airless” or non-pneumatic tire for the passenger vehicle market sparked the interest of many drivers. Although this prototype being fully developed, the future looks bright for this revolutionary tire.</P>
