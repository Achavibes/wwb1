        <h2>Women With Ambition - leadership </h2>
        <p> Female leadership involves women who influence and guide subordinates to work with confidence and zeal in order to achieve a common goal. Unfortunately, even though there is the growing need for female leaders in the world today, the surge of unequal opportunities between men and women, limited career advancement opportunities and gender or sexual based harassment are amongst the challenges encountered by women that deter them from striving to be leaders.</p>
        <p> WWB fosters female leadership through different ways. This includes: sensitization, Radio and television shows, workshop and training programs and others.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Empowerment - Women With Empowerment</h3>
                <p>Empowerment, Political, social or economic strength and confidence should be attained by a person to foster development. This strength can be developed mainly through capacity building which is important in strengthening skills and abilities of people. WWB anticipates that a society full of mandated people will lead to speedy development in different areas. This is not always the case, as wrong perceptions and inconsistencies are silent plagues to the goal. More often than not, the complacency of individuals especially women retard the growth of the society.</p>         
                <p>In a bid to empower women especially economically, WWB offers: financial literacy workshops, mentoring activities, Do It Yourself activities (DIY), as well as economic empowerment projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Advocacy is instrumental in supporting people and ensuring that their rights are not infringed on. The essence of advocacy is to enable effective policy implementation. The main areas of focus with regards to advocacy include upholding the protection of rights and striving towards peace and security for development. Regrettably, the rights of persons are often unconsidered especially in conflict stricken regions.WWB steps in as a watchdog to ensure that the rights and duties of people, especially women, are not relegated to the background. This is achieved through the following ways; Outreach activities (public education), Research, Public Speaking, Radio and tv shows.</p>
                <p>Would you like to procure the services of our seasoned advocates, contact us at our office! </p>

                <h3> Gender</h3>
                <p>Gender equality is in itself not rooted in dominance or bias treatment. It desires equal opportunities for all, irrespective of their gender. Sadly, the problem of gender inequality is still an issue in the 21st Century as gender- based violence, gender discrimination in education, sexual harassment, and early child marriages, just to name a few are still persistent.</p>
                <p> In the African Milieu especially, such ills including female genital mutilation are still in practice as part of some cultures. WWB steps in to carry on the following activities in order to curb the spread of gender inequality. This has been done severally through; Public speaking and Sensitization campaigns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3> Education</h3>
                <p> The right to education is a fundamental human right as enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. Education is important in every society and for all persons. Tragically, some families and communities reserve education for particular genders. Women Without Borders stands firm in propelling women irrespective of their age or status, towards achieving an education that would help them better manage their affairs.
                <p>Overtime, we have been able to educate people through: Outreach, workshops and sensitization programs. To arrange for a WWB educational Programme for your organization, government sector, or professional group, please contact our Buea office. We are excited to work with any logistical or organizational needs!</p>
