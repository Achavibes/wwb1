        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Since its creation, the Women without Borders (WWB) as an organization has been a voice and an instigator to improve Human Rights in Cameroon. During its existence, WWB has led actions on Advocacy, Empowerment, sensitization Campaigns as well as research to effect change in the Southwest Region and the Country at large. The origin of WWB dates back to 2014, when the founder Abrelegwi Ngoasong (also known Brenda) after attending an Oxfam International Kaleidoscope in New Delhi India, and having worked with other civil society organizations noticed a continuous abuse and violation of the rights of the vulnerable and minority persons especially women and children in her society. She thought it was imperative for her to add her voice with the others in order to create more awareness to redress the situation.</p>

                <h3>Our Activities</h3>
                <p>WWB's activities began with advocacy on Human rights abuses and violations. This initiated mediation programs from the grassroots to ensure the participation of women in decision-making processes in the traditional councils as well as the rural and municipal councils in Fako and Meme divisions.</p>

                <h3>Women Without Boarders To The World</h3>
                <p>From 2015 through 2016, WWB concentrated on Women, Children, and Youth Purpose-driven programs. These programs had as their focus, advocacy for African Womenâ€™s Rights as they continued to hold the perpetrators and the government accountable for violations and abuses against women, young girls and children. WWB spoke against several harmful practices like early marriages, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), sexual and reproductive health right, violence against women and girls (VAW/G), as well as women in leadership and the economy. Since the organization believed that social change is rooted in youth empowerment, they started carrying out youth programs by creating human rights and Peace clubs in schools and different communities across the South West regions aimed at promoting and protecting the rights of youths for sustainable peace and development through close work with them. </p>

        <h2>Our Services to Mankind</h2>
        <p>Female leadership involves women who influence and guide subordinates to work with confidence and zeal in order to achieve a common goal. Unfortunately, even though there is the growing need for female leaders in the world today, the surge of unequal opportunities between men and women, limited career advancement opportunities and gender or sexual based harassment are amongst the challenges encountered by women that deter them from striving to be leaders. WWB fosters female leadership through different ways. This includes: sensitization, Radio and television shows, workshop and training programs and others.</p>

        <h4>About Our Mission</h4>
        <p>In the wake of the Anglophone crisis in Cameroon; in the restive regions of the North West and South West, there have been massive human rights abuses by the armed forces and armed groups that have given birth to a humanitarian situation.</p>

            <p>The on-going crisis seems to be deteriorating each passing day; women and children have been affected disproportionately, incidents of Gender-based violence are on a rise, death rates keep soaring, arson, abductions, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, forced migration and gross impairment to physical integrities.</p>
            
            <p>This crisis has brought untold sufferings and increased vulnerabilities to the affected persons across the Anglophone regions. Thus WWB has been involved in advocating against these abuses and also providing humanitarian assistance to the needs of these affected persons through personal actions and referral pathways.</p>
